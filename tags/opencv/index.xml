      <description>In another life when I worked for a photobooth company, I was doing a lot of &amp;ldquo;creative coding&amp;rdquo; and one of the more interesting projects I worked on back then involved manipulating words into a portrait of an individual. This is probably the only project I ever agreed to that I had no idea how I was going to complete it. The algorithm wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect artistically, but it was good enough that we ended up using this for a few marketing campaigns so I thought I would detail it here.</description>
