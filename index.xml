      <description>Recently I had to build a CMS that had a web api that handled some image manipulations for the frontend. The project I was working on was already in .Net Core, so with the new cross platform support I wondered about the performance of it.
There are a lot of benchmarks around image resizing. My needs were a little more complicated, so there are 2 benchmarks: resizing and tiling in the context of web api.</description>
